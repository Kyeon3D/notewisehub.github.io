        <h3>Note Taking Techniques</h3>
        <p><mark>1.</mark><b>Annotating-</b>  Also known as “close reading,” it refers to the practice of marking and writing comments
            to enhance one's understanding and recall of the text he/she is reading (Eastern Washington
            University, 2020).</p>
        <b>How to Annotate:</b>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Marginal Notes:</b> Write brief comments or questions in the margins of the text. These notes can include your reactions, thoughts, or summaries of key points.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Underlining/Highlighting:</b> Mark important sentences, phrases, or keywords using underlines or highlights to draw attention to critical information.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Symbols:</b> Develop a system of symbols to represent different types of information, such as circling for emphasis, placing a question mark for confusing sections, or using an exclamation point for important insights.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Connections:</b> Make connections between different parts of the text, linking ideas, themes, or concepts. This helps in understanding the overall flow of the content.</p>

        <b>Benefits of Annotating</b>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Active Engagement:</b> Annotating requires active engagement with the material, preventing passive reading and promoting better understanding.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Personalization:</b> By adding personal comments and reflections, annotating allows you to create a personalized interaction with the text, making it more memorable.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Review Aid:</b> The annotated text serves as a valuable review tool, providing a concise summary of key points and your thoughts on the material.</p>

        <p>Annotating, or close reading, is a dynamic note-taking technique that actively involves the reader in the learning process. By interacting with the text through comments, markings, and symbols, annotating helps create a personalized and effective way to comprehend, remember, and engage with the material. Incorporating this method into your study routine can lead to improved understanding and retention of information.</p>




        <p><mark>2.</mark> <b>Outlining-</b> Outlining is a powerful note-taking technique that serves as a dual-purpose tool in both pre-writing and active reading. By systematically organizing information, outlining allows the reader to grasp the main points of a text and discern the underlying structure of the author's ideas.</p>
        <b>Benefits of Outlining</b>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Clarity and focus:</b> In the pre-writing phase, outlining is instrumental in bringing clarity to one's thoughts. It forces the writer to articulate the main ideas and supporting details, ensuring a focused and coherent composition.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark> <b>Logical Organization:</b> During reading, outlining aids in breaking down information into manageable components. This process helps identify the logical flow and organization of the text, revealing the structure employed by the writer to convey their ideas.</p>

        <b>Formal and Informal Outlining</b>
        <p><b>Formal Outlining</b> Formal outlines use alphanumeric and Roman numeral characters to denote the hierarchy of ideas. This method provides a structured and detailed overview of the text's main points, subpoints, and supporting details.</p>
        <mark>Example:</mark>
        <p><b>I. Main Point</b><br>
            <b>A. Supporting Detail</b><br>
               1. Subpoint<br>
               2. Subpoint<br>
            <b>B. Supporting Detail</b><br>
         II. Main Point
         </p>
         <p><b>Informal Outlining</b> Informal outlines, on the other hand, utilize bullets or other symbols to represent the relationships between ideas. This approach is more flexible and is often quicker for capturing thoughts in a spontaneous manner.</p>
         <mark>Example:</mark>
         <p><b>Main Point</b><br>
           <b> Supporting Detail</b><br>
            • Subpoint<br>
            • Subpoint<br>
            <b>Supporting Detail</b><br>
            • Main Point</p>

        <p>Incorporating outlining into both the writing and reading processes enhances not only the organization of ideas but also the comprehension of complex texts. Whether through formal structures or informal bullet points, outlining is a versatile tool that empowers individuals to navigate and make sense of information more effectively. As a skill, it contributes significantly to academic success and lifelong learning.</p>

        <p><mark>3. </mark><b>Summarizing- </b>According to Monterey Peninsula College (n.d.), “Summarizing reduces a text to its main idea and necessary information. It is shorter than the original text as it leaves out details and terms”. Freedman (n.d.) views summarizing as a test of one’s judgment on what concepts should be omitted or preserved. Listed below are some tips that she gave for summarizing a text:</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>Include the title and identify the author in your first sentence.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>The first sentence or two of your summary should contain the author’s thesis or central concept, stated in your own words. This is the idea that runs through the entire text–the one you’d mention if someone asked you: “What is this piece/article about?” Unlike student essays, the main idea in a primary document or an academic article may not be stated in one location at the beginning. Instead, it may be gradually developed throughout the piece, or it may become fully apparent only at the end.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>When summarizing a longer article, try to see how the various stages in the explanation or argument are built up in groups of related paragraphs. Divide the article into sections if it isn’t done in the published form. Then, write a sentence or two to cover the key ideas in each section.</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>Omit ideas that are not really central to the text. Don’t feel that you must reproduce the author’s exact progression of thought. (On the other hand, be careful not to misrepresent ideas by omitting important aspects of the author’s discussion).</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>In general, omit minor details and specific examples. (In some texts, an extended example may be a key part of the argument, so you would want to mention it).</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>Avoid writing opinions or personal responses in your summaries (save these for active reading responses or tutorial discussions).</p>
        <p><mark>•</mark>Be careful not to plagiarize the author’s words. If you do use even a few of the author’s words, they must appear in quotation marks. To avoid plagiarism, try writing the first draft of your summary without looking back at the original text.</p>
